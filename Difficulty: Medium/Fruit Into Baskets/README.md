<h2><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/fruit-into-baskets-1663137462/1">Fruit Into Baskets</a></h2><h3>Difficulty Level : Difficulty: Medium</h3><hr><div class="problems_problem_content__Xm_eO"><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array of <strong>arr[]</strong>, where <strong>arr[i] </strong>&nbsp;is the type of fruit the <strong>ith</strong> tree produces.<br>You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow :</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You only have <strong>two baskets</strong>, and each basket can only hold a <strong>single type</strong> of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick <strong>exactly one fruit</strong> from <strong>every&nbsp;</strong>tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of the baskets.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Given the integer array of fruits, return the <strong>maximum</strong> number of fruits you can pick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Examples:</strong></span></p>
<pre><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Input: </strong>arr[]= [2, 1, 2]<br><strong>Output:</strong> 3<br><strong>Explanation</strong>: We can pick one fruit from all three trees. Please note that the type of fruits is same in the 1st and 3rd baskets.</span></pre>
<pre><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Input</strong>: arr[] = [3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]<br><strong>Output: </strong>5<br><strong>Explanation</strong>: It's optimal to pick from the last 5 trees. Please note that we do not pick the first basket as we would have to stop at thrid tree which would result in only 2 fruits collected.</span></pre>

<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Constraints:</strong></span><br><span style="font-size: 18px;">1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10<sup>5</sup><br>1 ≤ arr[i] &lt;=n</span></p></div><br><p><span style=font-size:18px><strong>Topic Tags : </strong><br><code>two-pointer-algorithm</code>&nbsp;<code>Arrays</code>&nbsp;<code>Data Structures</code>&nbsp;<code>Algorithms</code>&nbsp;<code>Pointers</code>&nbsp;
